# Vic Quiz

This is an application that I originally created as a project for the React module in the course of a year at the Digital Career Institute.

In it I have used a free question Api: <a href="https://the-trivia-api.com" >"the-trivia-api"</a> and also, although unnecessarily, I have used a free API of the weather in the region where the device is located: <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">"openweathermap"</a>.

I would like to thank the whole team of "Digital Career Institue" for teaching me and developing my knowledge in programming.
